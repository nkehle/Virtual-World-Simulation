1. How to trigger the event
    When you click with the mouse on a space in the map

2. What should happen when the event is triggered
    A flaming meteor object appears on the point clicked. Around it the background changes
    to a black/burnt looking ash. If there is an entity at the point clicked, the meteor replaces it.
    If it is the first time pressing a key then, the nearest dudenotfull becomes a wizard entity and
    the nearest fairy becomes a heart entity.

3.What the new entity is and how it should behave
    I added two new entities. The first is a WIZARD entity that is a movable and uses a*star pathing and moves around
    the map at to random points and spawns a "superdude" which is a different appearing dudenotfull who has essentially
    no limit to the amount of trees he can cut ie. very large resourceLimit. The second entity I added is a HEART
    entity which is a MOVABLE and zooms around the map and plants sapling to try and counteract the wizard making the superdudes.

    The fun part is that the number of Hearts grows at somewhat of an exponential rate. For every 10 trees that a heart plants, it
    divides itself and becomes 2 heart entities.

    On the other side, the wizard is making superdudes at a constant rate, thus making it a competition of the forest and the dudes.

3. What the affected entities should do
   The affected entities are the nearest dude and the nearest fairy relevant to the where you click and place the meteor.
   The dude transforms into the wizard that supports team dude, and the fairy becomes a heart that is on team forest.

5. (If applicable) the names of each partner and what each partner was responsible for
    N/A


    Design Tradeoffs:
        One design tradeoff I found was having the initial event things start from VirtualWorld.java, and the moving the control
        as much as possible to simply the entities, and having things in their respective places.
